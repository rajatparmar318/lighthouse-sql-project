What issues will you address by cleaning the data?
Data-type Constraints: values in a particular column must be of a particular type. For example, the order date column in the Northwind database needs to be in a date format, not a numeric or boolean format.
Range Constraints: data should fall within a range. For example, the order date should not be in the future.
Mandatory Constraints: certain columns cannot be empty. For example, orderid, customerid should never be empty.
Unique Constraints: some fields must be unique. For customerid should always be unique.
