## Project/Goals
Project Goal is to create a database ecommerce in pgadmin. After that we have to import five csv files i.e all sessions, products, analytics, sales by sku and sales report. Then we have to clean our data inside the five datasets given and transform it to reach our objectives that are the five questions asked in starting with questions file.
## Process
### 
Provide relevant data types to the columns after scrutinizing the table.
Clean the data given in Excel using functions.
Clean the data in the given tables by using queries.
Create a view for each table so that if any function performed would not hamper the original table.


### 
Create an algorithm for each question first.
Apply relevant functions to retrieve data to reach objective.
